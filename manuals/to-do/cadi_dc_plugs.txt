Cadi DC plugs
===========

DC (Direct Current) plugs mean loads controlled with STM32's PWM-configured outputs.
DC plugs are used to drive the dosing (perylstaltic) pumps and other motors (idea: performing window opening tasks).
Since these outputs have controlling function only, the Cadi device should be equipped with corresponding MOSFET driver (see hardware section for examples of schematics and pcbs).
