v2 beta
- changed pinout according Cadi main board layout (HARDWARE/CADI-MAINBOARD/cadi_pcb_140210_polygoned_kamitra.rar)
- changed some LCD functions to init and drive LCD properly

v1.7
- implemented packet communication protocol for remote function calls
	uart_task to process packets and it's functions
- changed dht duty cycle array from 16bit to 8 bit


v1.6.3

v1.6.2
- now the water flow meter tick counter reseted when the valve is fully opened and waer dosing counting is then started, preventing "false" counting.
- refactored Lcd_write_16b for printing uint16_t values on LCD. Fixed over 255 value bug (and with adjust16bit() function as well).

v1.6.1
- calibrated values now stored in "EEPROM"
- more precise calibration of water flow meter

v1.6
- new function adjust16bit_fast() with additional argument - speed
- water flow counter calibration function
- function for water flow meter reading based volume top-up get_water()

v1.5
- fixed valve feedback init
- tank level stabilizer function and UI
- valve failure timeout
- valve feedback filter, to avoid unnecessary valve triggering


v1.4
- LCD data pins changed to PC10-12
- PB9 configured as sonar echo input
- PA5-7 for valve feedback
- introduced sonar driver
- introduced water flow meter driver
