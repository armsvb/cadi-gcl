Cadi Grow Controller and Logger timer system v2 
=====================================

New timer system suppose we have two kinds of timers:
	- SIMPLE
	- CHAINS

The simple timer could be one of three types:
	- 24H (all countings are done with 32bit timers' rests of division to 86400 (seconds in 24H). So, days are not respected, only hours, minutes, seconds)
	- Full Range (full 32bit range unixtime timer, has ON and OFF values, pointing exact year, month, day, hour, minute, second)
	- Cyclic (has 32bits for both duration and interval)

Each timer has 80bits of data (10bytes):
	- Timer type - TT[0..2]. 001 - 24H, 010 - Full Range, 011 - Cyclic
	- Timer Enabled - TE[3]. If set to 1, Cadi loads this timer for processing (depending on firmware working speed and delay changes due to changing the processing loop length, we should decide if we want the loop to be always fixed length, or we can let it be adjustable without having problems with main program flow. Этот параметр отвечает за включение таймера в очередь обработчика состояний таймеров. То есть, размер цикла for будет разным в зависимости от того какие таймеры включены. Это может повлиять на "гладкость" выполнения программы, что необходимо проверить на практике. Если будут проблемы, то простейшее решение - зафиксировать размер цикла)
	- TimerOn/Duration - TND[16..47]. 32 bits of data for timer ON or Duration, depending on type set in TE[0..2].
	- TimerOff/Interval - TFI[48..79]. Timer OFF or Interval
	

Chains - are 32bit sequences linking the SIMPLE timers together to get more complex timer programs. For instance, when we would like some cyclic timer would work within 24H timer ON window.
	Chain could have up to 5 timers united with AND operand. The first bit, showing if chain is enabled, could be a flag to process or not the chain in timer trigger cycle.
Structure of CHAIN timer is below:
	- ENABLED [0]. Main flag for enabling chain timer
	- TIM1ID[1..5]. 5 bits for first timer ID (1..32 or 0..31) in chain.
	- TIM2EN[6]. If set to 1, the second timer will be ANDed to first one.
	- TIM2ID[7..11]. The second timer ID.
	- TIM3EN[12]. Flag showing if we want to AND 3rd timer
	- TIM3ID[13..17].
	- TIM4EN[18]
	- TIM4ID[19..23]
	- TIM5EN[24]
	- TIM5ID[25..29]. 5th timer ID in chain

TIMER MEMORY AND CPU USAGE
During the system startup timers are loaded with function loadSettings(). Only these timers, which have ENABLED are loaded to process (if dynamic queue length selected). Timer loading suppose loading the timer IDs into timers2process array. This array size is predefined to 33 (count of timers at 0 position, and 32 timers from 1 to 32) and being filled with ID of timers to process. The first byte (timers2process[0]) shows the number of timers to process. The timer processing loop timerStateSet() makes timers2process[0] iterations (if dynamic queue defined) loading each timer once from emulated EEPROM. If memory available gives a possibility, then timer data (up to 32x10=320bytes are preloaded) and no emilated EEPROM cycles needed to process each timer each loop iteration.
To make cyclic timer start precisely Cadi timer system v2 introduce using complex timer to combine cyclic type with full-range type to adjust exactly the first run of cyclic timer. So, if cyclic timer met in the chain first, then second timer could be used (depending on TIM2EN flag) as additional condition, where TIM2[TimerOn] used as initial point of first start of cyclic timer TIM1. The second start of this cyclic timer (TIM1) happens TIM2[TimerOn]+TIM1[Interval]. The rest 3 timers in the chain are discarded then.
