Cadi plug settings
=============

Plug settings mean simple plug triggering rule assignment.
Each plug can have choosen (linked) one of 256 rules. So, rules has IDs from 0 to 255.
Within this range there are a number of blocks of rules. Below is a list
- 24H timers. rules[0..31]
- Full Range timers. rules[32..63]
- Cyclic timers. rules[64..95]
- Chains [96..127]

Each plug can have only one load, that could be turned ON or OFF (not like DC plugs, that could be PWMed). From other hand the correction operations are often need at least two loads to adjust desired value up and down (eg. heater and air conditioner for temperature stabilizing).

Example: the pH stabilizer should add acid when !pH above 5.8! with (1sec every 40secs), while circulation pump mixing added acid. When !pH below 5.5! another plug should turn on for (2 secs every 30secs) to add base. This should be like that within one month, then the same liquids should be added with same timings, but based on different window settings.

PLUG TRIGGERING
Each plug has its own rule attached. For attachment purpose special array used. The first element of this array shows the number of elements of this array to process (first field respected). Array element structure:
	- PLID. Plug ID from 0 to 255. AC plugs [1:16], DC plugs [17:32]
	- Rule ID from 0 to 255
The size of array is predefined during compilation. The number of IDs to process from this array could be dynamical based on number of plugs used. RuleID set to 255 means no action to this plug applied, no load into queue, no processing.


Window stabilization and automatic watering programs priorities
==============
The same dosing pump could have dual functionality - to stabilize the pH level of solution during a time, and for stabilizing pH level during the solution prepare process. While preparing the solution Cadi should not start any actions for stabilzing solution environment, until the watering/solution preparing finished. The list of plugs to stop stab mode serving within WP (watering program) run fetched from the settings for current WP.
